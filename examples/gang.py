"""Armada-specific: GANG scheduling (all-or-nothing co-scheduling of a distributed job).

    seed shards            give each worker a slice of a shared dataset
    worker (x N) ONE GANG  N co-dependent workers, scheduled all-or-nothing by Armada
    reduce                 combine the workers' contributions into the final result

The N workers form a GANG: they share a gang_id and all declare the same gang_cardinality = N, so
Armada places ALL N pods together or NONE. This is the right primitive for a distributed job whose
workers must run AT THE SAME TIME (an all-reduce ring, an MPI world, parameter-server + workers): a
worker that exchanges partial results every round cannot make progress while its peers are absent.
Gang scheduling means the job never holds half its workers idle: the whole cohort runs, or the gang
stays queued until it fits.

Contrast examples/fanout.py: those shards are INDEPENDENT and correctly use no gang (they should
start piecemeal as capacity frees up). Gangs are for co-dependent workers, not parallel busywork.

Gang placement is a property of the real Armada scheduler, so run this THROUGH THE BACKEND:

    ./demo/run.sh examples/gang.py
