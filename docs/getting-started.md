# Getting started

From zero to a Flyte 2 task running on Armada and showing up in the **Flyte UI**, on a local stack.

The end state: you write a `@env.task`, submit it through a Flyte backend, and watch Armada
schedule and run it as a pod in the Flyte console.

## 1. Bring up Armada (a local Kind cluster)

The connector submits to a running Armada cluster. From a checkout of the
[armada](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada) repo, create a local Kubernetes cluster and start
the stack with a real executor:

```
mage Kind            # create the Kind cluster "armada-test" and select its kube context
mage dev:up no-auth  # dependencies, migrations, and the full Armada stack with a real executor
```

`mage Kind` selects the `kind-armada-test` context, which the executor uses to create pods. Wait
until the executor logs `Reporting current free resource` and the scheduler logs
`Retrieved 1 executors` before submitting (jobs sent in the first ~60s fail with
`Retrieved 0 executors`, because the scheduler refreshes its executor list every 60s).

Create the queue the examples target, and give it a couple of seconds to propagate:

```
go run cmd/armadactl/main.go create queue flyte
```

Tear the cluster down later with `mage KindTeardown`, and stop the dependencies with `mage dev:down`.

## 2. Bring up a Flyte backend (a second cluster)

This is a separate cluster from Armada's, and that is by design. Armada runs your job pods on its own
kind cluster (step 1). The Flyte backend runs in its own k3d cluster, a "devbox" that holds the Flyte
control plane, the UI, and a blob store. It routes `armada` tasks to the connector, which submits them
to Armada, so the pods land on the Armada cluster. The two clusters talk through the connector service.

Stock Flyte 2 neither registers the Armada connector plugin nor routes `armada` tasks to it. The
`armada-devbox` branch adds both: the connector plugin (which is
[dejanzele/flyte#1](https://github.com/dejanzele/flyte/pull/1), upstreaming in progress) plus the
devbox config that routes `armada` tasks to the connector. Build the devbox from it. The build needs
Docker (with buildx), Helm, Kustomize, and Go on your PATH:

```
git clone -b armada-devbox https://github.com/dejanzele/flyte.git
cd flyte
make devbox-build    # one-time: builds the devbox image with the connector plugin and routing (a heavy build)
```

Both clusters expose their Kubernetes API on host port 6443, and the Armada cluster (step 1) already
took it. The devbox does not need its host API port for this setup (inspect it with
`docker exec flyte-devbox kubectl ...` instead), so start it without publishing 6443:

```
docker run -d --rm --privileged --name flyte-devbox \
  --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --env FLYTE_DEV=False \
  --volume flyte-devbox:/var/lib/flyte/storage \
  -p 30000:30000 -p 30001:5432 -p 30002:30002 -p 30080:30080 -p 30081:30081 \
  flyte-devbox:latest
```

`make devbox-run` does the same but also publishes 6443, which collides with the Armada cluster. The
Flyte UI comes up on `http://localhost:30080`; once it answers, continue. Stop the devbox later with
`docker rm -f flyte-devbox`. [../demo/](../demo/) describes what the run script expects from it.

## 3. Install this package

On Apple Silicon use an arm64 Python. An x86_64 interpreter cannot load Flyte's native `obstore`
wheel. From a checkout of this repo:

```
python3.11 -m venv .venv
./.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

To use the connector in your own project instead, install it directly:

```
pip install "armada-flyte @ git+https://github.com/dejanzele/armada-flyte.git"
```

## 4. Submit your first task

With Armada up (step 1) and a Flyte backend up (step 2), one command builds the task image, wires the
blob store, starts the connector service, and submits the example through the backend:

```
./demo/run.sh examples/hello.py
```

It prints a UI link and the result:

```
submitted run rf6zwrmnpzpwdgnfzffn
  UI: http://localhost:30080/v2/.../runs/rf6zwrmnpzpwdgnfzffn
hello armada, from an Armada pod
```

Open the `UI:` link to watch the run: Armada schedules the pod, runs the `@env.task`, and records the
typed result. Then try the other examples through the backend, for example
`./demo/run.sh examples/fanout.py` (a parallel fan-out) and `./demo/run.sh examples/gang.py` (an
all-or-nothing gang). The example surface is described in [../examples/](../examples/).

## Configuration

The connector's settings (endpoint, the blob store the pods use, and later auth/TLS) resolve in
this order, lowest to highest: built-in defaults, then the environment, then in-code overrides.

- **Environment**: `ARMADA_URL` (default `localhost:50051`, the Armada submit/status gRPC endpoint),
  and `FLYTE_BLOB_ENDPOINT` / `FLYTE_BLOB_ACCESS_KEY` / `FLYTE_BLOB_SECRET_KEY` for the blob store.
  The run scripts set these for you.
- **In code**: `armada_flyte.configure(armada_url=...)`, called before the first task runs. This is
  the home for credentials (it never reaches your task config or the control-plane DB). For the
  backend, call it in the connector service launcher.

Settings resolve lazily on first use, so `configure()` works after `import armada_flyte` (no
set-the-env-var-before-import ordering trap).

Other knobs:

- `ARMADA_TASK_IMAGE` (default `armada-flyte-task:v1`): the task image the runner builds and loads.

If something does not behave, check [gotchas.md](gotchas.md) first. Most setup problems are
listed there.
